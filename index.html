    <p> Mauricio is a Texas based visual designer. He has been dabbling in UX and UI design, immersing himself in the balance of aesthetics and 
        usability. This journey is fueled by a desire to understand user needs and a drive to create interfaces that are both beautiful and intuitive.
         Sketching wireframes and playing with color schemes, heâ€™s honing his skills to craft digital experiences that captivate and connect.
